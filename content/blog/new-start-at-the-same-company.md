# Start

It’s almost a year since I started my first full-time designer job. I still
remember how excited I was on my first day of work. Although I have a few
internship experiences in the past, it felt different and real this time that I
can tell other people I’m a designer.

For the past nine months at work, most of the work I got was production work,
meaning that I didn’t really get to design as much as I imagine when I first
started this job. I was a bit disappointed but at the same time, I felt like
doing production work was not necessarily bad for my design career. Of course,
it was not as creative, as fun as I like to be, but I was still learning design,
learning how to communicate with people effectively, most important of all, I
got into the door to have my first full-time designer job. I knew how difficult
and how lucky I was to get this opportunity because I’ve been through that never
heard back after applying multiple jobs phase before.

By doing production work, I learned to work with the different art directors and
realized that every art director has their own working style. I also learned how
to work with a whole team, including project manager, developer art director,
and another production artist.

Communication is the most important soft skill I like to cultivate in my design
career, especially for a person like me who usually doesn’t like to talk too
much. I learned how to work with people remotely because I have lots of team
members who mostly work from their homes. One of the method I like to use is to
write down everything I like to communicate with my co-workers in bullet
points. The notes become very helpful either when I need to write an email or
hop on an online phone call with them.

I’ve tried to push myself out of my comfort zone and learned from my co-workers
every day. I was super lucky that most of my co-workers are supportive, selfless
and willing to share their knowledge with me. I am grateful for doing all these
production artists’ work because it makes me realize the importance of
teamwork. It’s difficult to deliver a great project without a whole support team
and everyone’s hard work.

# Change

Things started to change in this March, our company decided to move our team and
combine us to the other team. In the beginning, I thought nothing is going to
change, I’ll still work with the same team and do the same production work I
used to do. However, I realized that I was put into a new team with a new
manager in a regular team meeting. I was not expect this to happen so I was a
bit nervous in the beginning. After this meeting, things started to change
rapidly. For example, I was no longer working on the previous project. Of
course, the once a week 1:1 meeting with my previous manager got canceled.

I was a little anxious at the beginning of this transition because I didn’t have
any work to do, plus the uncertainty feeling of the pandemic that is happening
all over the world. I took two days off from work and tried to calm myself
down. Practicing calligraphy and learning new skills definitely help a lot. It
prevented myself from keeping digging into the hole and having all the negative
thoughts.

At that moment, I tried to focus on what I can do instead of what I can’t
do. Then things started to get better.

After two days off from work, I got myself all charged up and was ready to get
back to work. Instead of sitting there waiting for work coming and reading all
the scary news related to the pandemic, I decided to use this downtime to
cultivate my 3D skill. This is the pure joy of learning, I highly recommend you
to find a new thing to learn no matter how busy you are.

# New Start

After a few days of practicing calligraphy and learning 3D software, things
started to get back on track. I started to talk to my new manager and got
familiar with the new team. Then I started to get work to do again.

I was working on an internal marketing supportive project, for instance, I
created a few illustrations for the blog post banners. These were all new things
for me, I didn’t do a lot of illustration in the past. Also, I needed to start
learning the new team’s design style, I studied their brand guideline, including
what typeface, colors and illustration style they use. I love and enjoy doing
these so much.

It’s been only two weeks since I started working with the new team. I noticed
lots of differences in terms of working style and things that I want to improve
in the future. For instance, I started to work on more creative projects,
including the illustration project I mentioned before. Also I am working on a
roadmap design currently. I can’t be happier with this drastic change which I
was nervous and scared in the beginning.

# Things I’ve Learned

I definitely felt more pressure and faced more challenges than before but I
learn and grow so much in the past two weeks! I got to make design decisions and
was responsible for what I created. I keep pushing myself and try to step out of
my comfort zone in terms of sharing and talking more about my work. Also, giving
other designers critique is still an on-going task I am working on.

Looking back, I wish I can start practicing my critique skills when I was at
college. But it’s never too late to start, it’s a great opportunity and timing
to start working on the critique skills now.

I’m sure there will be more challenges waiting for me in the future but I’m
ready and believe in myself that I can conquer these. I’ll keep posting my
progress and what I learn in my new team in the future. New team, new
start. Stay tuned!
